    "# Introduction to Python Packages\n",
    "\n",
    "Contributors: Daniel Lay\n",
    "\n",
    "This is Part 2 of an introductory notebook. This assumes that you understand functions, lists, print statements, and so on, at least at the level of the first Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, you don't need to install anything on your computer. In general, you will want to install all of the packages used below; a guide to Anaconda is linked in the resources page of the previous notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a simple bit of motivation, suppose we want to compute the eigenvalue decomposition of a matrix (you will learn about this in the summer course if you're unfamiliar). There are a number of algorithms metioned on the Wikipedia page, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eigenvalue_algorithm, but how do you know which one to use? Do you even want to write your own? After all, doing so is time-consuming and error-prone.\n",
    "\n",
    "The answer is, no: you do not have to write your own! Python lets you use what is called a *package*, or a collection of functions/classes, whenever you want. This makes it easy to use pre-written code for common things you might want to do, such as:\n",
    "- Matrix operations (transposes, inverses, eigenvalue decomposition, etc.)\n",
    "- Plotting data (scatterplot, contour plot, 3d graphics, etc.)\n",
    "- Using special functions (trigonometric, polynomials, special functions, etc.)\n",
    "- Reading to/writing from a file\n",
    "\n",
    "So, for an enormous amount of things you want to do, you basically don't have to write *any code at all*. These applications, and many more, will be detailed throughout the summer course, and the rest of the Jupyter notebooks. For now, let's first learn how to use a package."
